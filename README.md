## 🎯 What is Cypher?

Cypher is not a framework for building applications. It is a **meta-framework for building custom Knowledge Frameworks** while you build applications.

We began building a task orchestrator. We discovered we were cultivating a garden of knowledge. The application you build is the catalyst; the **reusable wisdom** for that specific tech stack is the true product.

Cypher is a living, learning ecosystem where:
- **Commands don't execute tasks** - they teach you to execute them better
- **Every interaction makes the system wiser** - knowledge compounds, not resets
- **Dialogue IS the process** - plans emerge from conversation, not templates
- **The filesystem thinks** - distributed intelligence lives where it belongs

> "You are not implementing tasks. You are teaching an ecosystem to understand itself better."

## 📚 Philosophy

### Commands as Teachers
```bash
# Not: cypher generate-context → generates context
# But: cypher context → teaches HOW to build context
```

### The Learning Cycle
```
Plan (dialogue) → Execute (with guidance) → Learn (extract wisdom) → Evolve (update guides)
```

Each cycle makes the entire ecosystem more intelligent.

## 🛠️ Commands

### Process Commands (Interactive Guides)
- **`cypher plan`** - "Let's talk about this" - Facilitates planning dialogue
- **`cypher context`** - Guides effective context construction
- **`cypher validate`** - Multi-layer validation guidance
- **`cypher learn`** - Extract patterns, update guides, evolve
- **`cypher explore`** - Open-ended research assistance

### Information Commands (Simple Queries)
- **`cypher list`** - List tasks with filters
- **`cypher show`** - Display task details
- **`cypher update`** - Update task status
- **`cypher next`** - Show next pending task

## 🏗️ Architecture

```

├── prompts/        # Living guides that improve with use
├── patterns/       # Extracted wisdom from experience

    └── <task-id>/

```

The filesystem isn't just organization - it's distributed intelligence.

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- npm or yarn

### Install from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/cypher.git
cd cypher
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 0. Start with Your Requirements
Transform your project requirements into tasks. See `cypher/core-docs/prd-to-tasks.md`.

### 1. Initialize Cypher
```bash
cypher init
```

Creates the knowledge ecosystem structure in your project.

### 2. View Tasks
```bash
cypher list
```

### 3. Start a Planning Dialogue
```bash
cypher plan 1.1
```
This doesn't generate a plan - it starts a conversation about how to approach the task.

### 4. Build Context Together
```bash
cypher context 1.1
```
The guide teaches you what context to gather and why.

### 5. Execute
Use your normal tools. The context ensures AI understands:
- Project conventions
- Existing patterns
- What to avoid

### 6. Learn and Evolve
```bash
cypher learn 1.1
```
Extract patterns, update guides, make the system wiser.

## 📖 Key Concepts

### The Cypher Way

When approaching any task:
1. **Start with dialogue** - Let understanding emerge through conversation
2. **Seek existing wisdom** - Check patterns and past retrospectives
3. **Create minimal artifacts** - Only what emerges from need
4. **Capture learnings** - Every task should make the system wiser
5. **Trust the process** - The framework guides, you decide

### Core Principles

1. **Commands as Teachers** - Guide processes, don't automate them
2. **Dialogue IS the Process** - Plans emerge from conversation
3. **Evolution Through Use** - Every task makes the system smarter
4. **Context is Living Memory** - Not loaded, but inhabited
5. **Patterns Over Rules** - Capture what works, not what should work
6. **Organic Over Systematic** - Let patterns emerge from usage

## 🌱 The Evolution Continues

Cypher is not a framework that does things. It's an ecosystem that teaches you to do things better, and gets wiser every time you use it.

We don't manage tasks. We cultivate understanding.
We don't generate solutions. We discover them through dialogue.
We don't execute plans. We learn from experiences.

The ultimate goal isn't task completion - it's system evolution.
