# AI-First Artifacts: The Core Design Principle

## Critical Understanding

**These artifacts are NOT documentation. They are precision-engineered context for AI implementation agents.**

## What Makes an Artifact "AI-First"?

### 1. Token Economy
Every field, every word must justify its token cost:
- ❌ "This field represents the complexity score" (wasteful)
- ✅ "complexity": 8 (efficient)

### 2. Implementation Focus
- ❌ Explanations of why something should be done
- ✅ Direct instructions on what to implement

### 3. Structured for Machine Parsing
```json
// Bad: Variable structure
{
  "task": "Sometimes a string, sometimes an object"
}

// Good: Consistent, predictable
{
  "task": {
    "id": "always-present",
    "title": "always-string"
  }
}
```

### 4. Self-Contained Context
Each artifact must contain ALL information needed for implementation:
- No references to external documents
- No assumptions about prior knowledge
- Complete specification in one file

## Examples: Human vs AI-First

### Human-Oriented (BAD for our use case)
```json
{
  "explanation": "We chose SQLAlchemy because it provides a robust ORM layer that abstracts database operations while maintaining flexibility",
  "rationale": "UUID primary keys offer better distribution in clustered environments",
  "background": "This follows the repository pattern commonly used in DDD"
}
```

### AI-First (GOOD)
```json
{
  "technology": "SQLAlchemy 2.0",
  "pattern": "repository",
  "implementation": {
    "primaryKey": "UUID with default=uuid4",
    "baseClass": "DeclarativeBase",
    "example": "id: Mapped[UUID] = mapped_column(primary_key=True, default=uuid4)"
  }
}
```

## The TEP Example: AI-First in Action

The TEP enriched file demonstrates perfect AI-first design:

```json
{
  "implementation": {
    "phases": [
      {
        "phase": 1,
        "subtasks": ["2.1", "2.7", "2.9"],
        "duration": "1-2 days"
      }
    ],
    "keyDecisions": [
      {
        "decision": "UUID Generation Strategy",
        "recommendation": "Use Python-side generation with default_factory=uuid4",
        "rationale": "Immediate ID access, database portability"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Note:
- No fluff, just actionable data
- Clear structure for programmatic access
- Implementation-ready details

## Measuring AI-First Quality

Ask these questions:
1. Could Claude Code implement this without any other context?
2. Is every token contributing to implementation accuracy?
3. Can the structure be navigated programmatically?
4. Are instructions unambiguous and actionable?

If any answer is "no", the artifact needs refinement.

## The Ultimate Test

Give your artifact to Claude Code with this prompt:
```
"Implement based on this specification: [artifact]"
```

If Claude Code asks clarifying questions, your artifact isn't AI-first enough.

## Future Evolution

As AI agents become more sophisticated, artifacts can become even more compressed:
- Today: Detailed JSON with examples
- Tomorrow: Compressed schemas with references
- Future: Binary encodings optimized for AI

But the principle remains: **Every byte must serve the implementation agent**.
