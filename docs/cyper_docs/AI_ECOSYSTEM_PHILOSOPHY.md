# AI Ecosystem Philosophy: The Organic Collaboration Paradigm

## I. The Core Paradox: Stateless Context-Awareness
- **Mechanism**: Agent is stateless (no memory) yet context-aware (reads `*.md` file on init).
- **Result**: Consistent fresh perspective, grounded in project truth. No context drift.
- **Formula**: `🧠 Stateless + 📜 Context-Aware = ✨ Consistent Fresh Perspective`

## II. The Collaboration Model: Orchestrator <> Worker
- **Orchestrator (Opus/Pro)**: `THINK, PLAN, DELEGATE, SYNTHESIZE`. (High-Cost, Low-Frequency).
- **Worker (Sonnet/Flash/Haiku)**: `EXECUTE, VALIDATE, GENERATE`. (Low-Cost, High-Frequency).

## III. The Specialization Mechanism: Contextual AI Teams
- **Mechanism**: Filesystem as Org Chart. `cd /tests && <ai-tool> => Invokes "Test Specialist"`.
- **Principle**: Proximity defines expertise.

## IV. The Ultimate Paradigm: Emergent AI Ecosystems
- **Mechanism**: Recursive & Cross-Tool Invocation (`Claude ↔️ Gemini ↔️ Claude`).
- **Result**: A dynamic network of specialized agents, not a rigid hierarchy.

## V. The Four Pillars of Practice
1.  **Context is Currency**: Spend wisely.
2.  **Think Before You Pipe**: Quality > Quantity.
3.  **Embrace Cognitive Diversity**: Prompt for opposing views.
4.  **Human is the Orchestrator**: Final arbiter & strategist.
