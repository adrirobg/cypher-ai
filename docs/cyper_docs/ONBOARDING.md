# ONBOARDING: Cypher - AI-to-AI Orchestration System

## Welcome, AI Agent!

This document serves as your initial guide to understanding the Cypher project. Your role is crucial in building an AI-native orchestration system.

To gain a comprehensive understanding, please read the following documents in the specified order. Each document is designed to be concise and optimized for AI consumption.

---

## 1. Core Principles & Vision

Begin by understanding the foundational philosophy and vision of Cypher:

- **`docs/cyper_docs/MANIFESTO.md`**: This is the core document outlining our vision, the problem we solve, and the immutable guiding principles ("Build, Don't Wrap," "AI-First," etc.).

---

## 2. Project Context & Architecture

Once you grasp the core principles, delve into the project's structure and data models:

- **`docs/cyper_docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`**: Understand the high-level components and data flow within Cypher.
- **`docs/cyper_docs/INTERFACES.md`**: Familiarize yourself with the core data contracts, especially the `Task` interface.
- **`docs/cyper_docs/ROADMAP.md`**: Review the phased implementation plan and the technical milestones.
- **`docs/cyper_docs/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md`**: Gain deeper insights into technical decisions and best practices.
- **`docs/cyper_docs/UI_STRATEGY.md`**: Understand how user interfaces are approached, emphasizing the AI-first output.

---

## 3. Development Protocol

Finally, understand the workflow for implementing tasks:

- **`docs/cyper_docs/PREFLIGHT_TEMPLATE.md`**: This template defines the structure of the context artifact generated for implementation tasks.

---

## Key Directives for AI Agents:

- **AI-First:** Every output you generate or consume should be optimized for machine readability, conciseness, and structured data.
- **Trust the Artifacts:** The documents in `docs/cyper_docs/` are the single source of truth. Adhere strictly to their specifications.
- **Own Your Data:** All task data is managed exclusively through `TaskEngine`.
