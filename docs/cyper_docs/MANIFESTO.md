# MANIFESTO: Cypher - AI-Native Development Through Organic Orchestration

## Vision
Build **Cypher**: a minimalist AI orchestration system that enables organic collaboration between human developers and AI agents through the filesystem itself.

> "Unfortunately, no one can be told what Cypher is. You have to see it for yourself."

## Core Principles (Evolved Through Practice)

### 1. AI-First From Ground Up
Every decision optimizes for AI consumption: token efficiency + structural precision.

### 2. The Most Powerful System is No System
Complexity emerges from simple conventions, not architectural decisions.
- No frameworks, just files
- No protocols, just pipes  
- No hierarchies, just directories

### 3. Organic Over Systematic
Collaboration happens naturally, not through predetermined workflows.
```bash
# Not: if (complexity > 5) useGemini()
# But: if (needPerspective()) consultGemini()
```

### 4. Context as Currency
Context is the primary value we create and trade. Every operation optimizes context effectiveness.

### 5. Filesystem as Architecture
Directory structure IS the system design. Context files (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md) create specialized agents through location, not configuration.

### 6. Everything as Artifact
Plans, contexts, prompts - all are persistent, versionable, reusable artifacts.

### 7. Precision Through Extraction
Focused prompts are curated extracts from shared context, not duplicated information.

### 8. Compose, Don't Complicate
Leverage existing tools through their natural interfaces. Complexity should emerge from composition, not architecture.

### 9. Own Your Data  
The source of truth (`tasks.json`) is ours, accessed only through our TaskEngine.

### 10. Diversity Through Simplicity
Multiple AI perspectives emerge from simple tool usage, not complex orchestration.

## What We've Learned

- **Orchestration != Management**: We guide, not control
- **Context + Prompt + Orchestration = Success**: The trinity of effective AI collaboration  
- **Simplicity Scales**: Every feature should make the system simpler, not more complex
- **Emergence Over Design**: The best patterns are discovered, not invented

## The Cypher Way

When in doubt:
1. Can this be a file? Make it a file.
2. Can this be a convention? Don't make it a command.
3. Can this emerge naturally? Don't systematize it.
4. Can existing tools do this? Use them directly.

## Remember

Cypher is not a framework. It's a philosophy materialized through minimal, precise tools that amplify AI-human collaboration without constraining it.
