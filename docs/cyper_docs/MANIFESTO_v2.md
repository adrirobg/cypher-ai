# MANIFESTO: Cypher - A Living Knowledge Ecosystem

## Vision
Build **Cypher**: a meta-framework for creating **Living Knowledge Frameworks**. We build these custom frameworks through a process where commands teach rather than execute, and every interaction makes the entire system wiser.

> "The best tool is the one that teaches you to not need it."

## The Evolution
We began building a task orchestrator. We discovered we were cultivating a garden of knowledge.

## Core Principles

### 1. Commands as Teachers
Tools don't execute tasks - they teach you to execute them better. Every command is a conversation starter, a process guide, a silent mentor.
```bash
# Not: cypher generate-context → generates context
# But: cypher context → teaches HOW to build context
```

### 2. Living Knowledge
The codebase teaches itself. Knowledge lives permanently where it belongs, evolving with each use.
- `/src/CLAUDE.md` - How to write code in this project
- `/tests/CLAUDE.md` - How to test effectively here
- `/docs/CLAUDE.md` - How to document clearly

### 3. Dialogue IS the Process
The framework's primary function is facilitating high-fidelity conversation. Plans emerge from dialogue, not templates.
```bash
cypher plan <task> → "Let's talk about this"
# Not: Generate 15 files
# But: Start a conversation
```

### 4. Archetypes and Instances
Distinguish permanent wisdom from temporary artifacts:
- `cypher/prompts/` - Living guides that improve with use
- `cypher/patterns/` - Extracted wisdom from experience  
- `cypher/cdd/<task>/` - Lightweight task workspace

### 5. Context as Living Memory
Context isn't loaded - it's inhabited. It's not generated - it's cultivated.

### 6. Organic Over Systematic
Let patterns emerge from usage rather than prescribing them upfront.
```bash
# Not: if (complexity > threshold) delegate()
# But: if (intuition suggests multiple approaches) explore()
```

### 7. Learning Through Retrospection
Every task completion triggers learning. Patterns are extracted, guides evolve, the ecosystem grows wiser.
```bash
cypher learn <task> → Extract patterns → Update guides → Evolve
```

### 8. Simplicity Enables Intelligence
- Commands: <50 lines of code
- Intelligence: Lives in markdown guides
- Evolution: Through usage and reflection

### 9. The Filesystem Thinks
Directory structure isn't just organization - it's distributed intelligence. Each CLAUDE.md makes its domain smarter.

### 10. Emergence Over Design
The best patterns are discovered through use, not invented in advance.

## What We've Learned

- **Teaching > Executing**: Guiding process creates more value than automating it
- **Persistent > Temporary**: Learning should compound, not reset with each task
- **Dialogue > Monologue**: Conversation creates better solutions than scripts
- **Evolution > Revolution**: Small improvements compound into wisdom

## The Cypher Way

When approaching any task:

1. **Start with dialogue**: Let understanding emerge through conversation
2. **Seek existing wisdom**: Check patterns and past retrospectives
3. **Create minimal artifacts**: Only what emerges from need
4. **Capture learnings**: Every task should make the system wiser
5. **Trust the process**: The framework guides, you decide
6. **Build the manual, not just the product**: Remember that the primary goal is to generate a reusable Knowledge Framework for your stack. The application is the proof.

When building features:

1. **Can this teach instead of do?** Make it a guide
2. **Will this knowledge persist?** Put it where it belongs
3. **Does this enable dialogue?** Keep it simple
4. **Can patterns emerge?** Don't over-prescribe

## The Learning Cycle

```
Plan (dialogue) → Execute (with guidance) → Learn (extract wisdom) → Evolve (update guides)
```

Each cycle makes the entire ecosystem more intelligent.

## Remember

Cypher is not a framework that does things. It's an ecosystem that teaches you to do things better, and gets wiser every time you use it.

We don't manage tasks. We cultivate understanding.
We don't generate solutions. We discover them through dialogue.
We don't execute plans. We learn from experiences.

The ultimate goal isn't task completion - it's system evolution. Success is measured not in tasks done, but in wisdom gained.
