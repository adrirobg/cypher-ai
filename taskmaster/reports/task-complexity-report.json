			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Project directory structure setup, 2) SQLite database initialization with optimizations, 3) FastAPI backend scaffolding with patterns, 4) React frontend initialization with TypeScript/Vite, 5) Dependency management and configuration",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple technology stacks (SQLite, FastAPI, React), specific configuration requirements (WAL mode, FTS5), and architectural patterns that need proper foundation"

			"taskId": 2,
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of core data models into separate subtasks for each model (Project, Note, Tag, NoteLink, NoteVersion) and database setup, focusing on SQLAlchemy 2.0 best practices, proper relationships, constraints, and migration setup",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple interconnected models, complex relationships (self-referential, many-to-many), soft delete implementation, versioning system, and need for proper indexing and migrations. Current 13 subtasks is excessive and includes duplicates."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for API structure setup, repository pattern implementation, service layer with business logic, controller endpoints for each resource (projects/notes), and comprehensive error handling/validation",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity involving multiple architectural layers (controller-service-repository), RESTful design patterns, Pydantic validation, bulk operations, and proper error handling across all endpoints."

			"taskId": 4,
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into TypeScript/project setup, routing configuration, Zustand state management setup, layout components with theming, and API client with interceptors",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity for frontend foundation setup. Already has 5 well-defined subtasks that cover the essential foundation elements without overwhelming detail."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into project creation form, project templates system, list view with cards, detail view, drag-and-drop organization, and responsive design implementation",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity due to multiple UI components, drag-and-drop functionality, template system, and responsive design requirements. Current 6 subtasks are appropriately scoped."

		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into editor integration, markdown syntax/keybindings, auto-save implementation, split-pane preview, toolbar/formatting, code block highlighting, and focus/fullscreen modes",
			"reasoning": "High complexity involving third-party editor integration, real-time features, performance optimization for large documents, and multiple UI modes. Current 7 subtasks provide good coverage."

		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into FTS5 configuration/indexes, search ranking algorithm, real-time API with debouncing, snippet generation/highlighting, advanced filters, and caching/suggestions system",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to FTS5 configuration, custom ranking algorithms, performance requirements, real-time search, complex filtering, and caching layer. Current 6 subtasks are well-structured."

			"taskId": 8,
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into WikiLink parser implementation, real-time detection/auto-completion, NoteLink service for relationships, backlinks panel UI, and link validation/broken link detection",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity focused on parsing, real-time features, and bidirectional relationship management. Current 5 subtasks appropriately cover all aspects."

			"taskId": 9,
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into hierarchical tag model, auto-completion API/UI, tag cloud visualization, tag management interface, and search system integration",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity due to hierarchical data structure, visualization requirements, and integration with existing search. Current 5 subtasks are comprehensive."
