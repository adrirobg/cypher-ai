## Navigation Guide

### For Understanding System
1. Start: `/core-docs/quickstart.md`
2. Deep dive: `/core-docs/philosophy.md`
3. Technical: `/core-docs/architecture.md`

### For Executing Tasks
1. Planning: `/prompts/planning-guide.md`
2. Context: `/prompts/context-guide.md`
3. Validation: `/prompts/validation-guide.md`

### For Following Rules
- Git: `/project-rules/git-workflow.md`
- Docs: `/project-rules/ai-documentation-standards.md`

### For Finding Solutions
- Check `/patterns/` for similar problems
- Check `/knowledge/` for strategic guidance

## Key Files

### `tasks.json`
The task database. Central source of truth for all tasks.

### `manifest.md` (this file)
Root navigation guide for AI agents.

## Growth Areas

These directories start empty and grow through use:
- `/patterns/` - Fills with reusable solutions
- `/knowledge/` - Accumulates strategic insights
- `/cdd/` - Records of each task dialogue
