# Knowledge Manifest

Version: 1.0.0
Updated: 2025-01-19
Purpose: Index of strategic knowledge and architectural insights

## Current Knowledge

### Active Documents
- `future-ideas.md` - Collected ideas for system evolution

### Knowledge Categories (Growing)

#### System Evolution
- Architectural decisions and their rationale
- Failed approaches and why they failed
- Successful strategies and their context

#### Process Insights  
- Effective collaboration patterns
- Common pitfalls and avoidance strategies
- Optimization discoveries

#### Domain Wisdom
- Project-specific conventions discovered
- Integration patterns that work well
- Performance insights

## How Knowledge Accumulates

1. Through `cypher learn` command
2. Through retrospective analysis
3. Through pattern generalization
4. Through failure analysis

## Knowledge vs Patterns

### Patterns (Tactical)
- Specific, reusable code solutions
- Implementation techniques
- Concrete approaches

### Knowledge (Strategic)
- High-level principles
- Architectural insights  
- Process wisdom
- Meta-learnings
