# Patterns Manifest

Version: 1.0.0
Updated: 2025-01-19
Purpose: Index of reusable solutions and code patterns

## Current Patterns

*This directory starts empty and fills through the `cypher learn` command.*

## Pattern Categories (Future)

### Code Patterns
- Component structures
- API designs  
- Error handling approaches
- Testing strategies

### Architecture Patterns
- Module organization
- State management
- Integration approaches
- Performance optimizations

### Process Patterns
- Debugging workflows
- Refactoring strategies
- Migration approaches
- Review processes

## How Patterns Are Added

1. Complete a task successfully
2. Run `cypher learn <task-id>`
3. Learning guide helps extract reusable patterns
4. Patterns are saved here with metadata

## Pattern File Format

```markdown
# Pattern: [Name]

Source: task-[id]
Category: [code|architecture|process]
Created: [date]

## Problem
[What problem this solves]

## Solution
[The reusable approach]

## Example
[Concrete implementation]

## When to Use
[Conditions where this applies]

## When NOT to Use  
[Anti-conditions]
```

## Using Patterns

- Reference in planning: "Check patterns for similar problems"
- Reference in context: "@cypher/patterns/[pattern-name].md"
- Apply during implementation
- Validate against pattern in review
